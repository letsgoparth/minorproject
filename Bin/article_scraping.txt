1.Computer vision enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs and take actions or make recommendations based on that information. However, Computer vision is not the same as AI in Visual. Where artificial intelligence allows a computer to form thoughts, computer vision enables a computer to see and process visual information. Visual AI needs to be employed to visually analyze, learn from experience, and emulate human intelligence while processing visual information.
2.An example to illustrate the use of such classification algorithms would be Optical Character Recognition (OCR). OCR is a computer vision task that is widely used in our everyday lives. OCR carries out text recognition, and it is commonly used in order to digitize paper-based documents and make them machine-readable so that further analysis/work can be easily carried out. For example, Medical notes and reports can be digitized so that patient data can be easily extracted for further analysis of disease rates.
